I have developed a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrated with local storage, allowing users to create and manage daily tasks efficiently. 
The website incorporates a user-friendly interface with the following features:

1. Task Creation and Labeling: Users can create tasks and differentiate them by assigning labels.
2. Adding and Deleting Labels: To begin, users can create a label using a convenient "+ button" located in the top right corner of the screen. Adding tasks and deleting labels can be done through the "Add Task" and "Delete" buttons, respectively.
3. Task Information: Each task includes essential details, such as the task name, due date, and description.
4. Local Storage: Tasks created are automatically saved in the browser's local storage for easy retrieval.
5. Task Management: Users can efficiently manage tasks by utilizing the "Delete" or "Update" buttons, situated below each task.
6. Initial Display: Upon loading the website, only the first label is visible, and if no labels exist, the screen remains blank.
7. Label Navigation: Convenient navigation buttons ("Previous" and "Next") allow users to switch between different labels smoothly.
8. Task Relocation: Users have two methods to move tasks between labels. First, by clicking the "Move" button, they are directed to a form where they can select the destination label. Second, users can drag and drop tasks onto the buttons for next or previous labels, effectively transferring the task to the desired label.

The website offers a seamless and intuitive user experience, making task management a breeze.
